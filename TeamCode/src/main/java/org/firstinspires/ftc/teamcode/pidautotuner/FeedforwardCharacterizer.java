/**
 * Computes the feedforward gain {@code kF} for velocity control.

 * <p>Relay feedback (see {@link RelayAutoTuner}) measures the dynamics of the
 * system but does not by itself tell you how much power is needed to sustain
 * a given velocity with zero error -- that's the feedforward term. This class
 * characterizes it separately: drive the motor open-loop at one or more fixed
 * power levels, let the velocity settle, and record (power, steady-state
 * velocity) pairs. {@code kF} is then the slope of the best-fit line through
 * the origin: {@code power = kF * velocity}.
 *
 * <p>For a single test point (the simplest case -- run the motor at full
 * power and record the steady-state velocity), this reduces to the familiar
 * {@code kF = 1.0 / maxVelocity} (in power-per-tick/sec units).
