/**
 * Implements the relay feedback ("bang-bang") auto-tuning method described by
 * Astrom &amp; Hagglund (1984). The output is driven hard in one direction
 * whenever the measurement is below the setpoint (minus a hysteresis band)
 * and hard in the other direction whenever it's above the setpoint (plus the
 * hysteresis band). This forces the system into a sustained, limit-cycle
 * oscillation, from which the ultimate gain {@code Ku} and ultimate period
 * {@code Tu} can be extracted and fed into Ziegler-Nichols style tuning
 * rules (see {@link ZieglerNicholsCalculator}).
 *
 * <p>This class is purely mathematical -- it does not know about motors,
 * encoders, or OpModes. The caller is responsible for, each control-loop
 * iteration:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>taking a measurement (encoder position or velocity)</li>
 *     <li>calling {@link #update(double, double)} with that measurement and
 *         the current timestamp in seconds</li>
 *     <li>applying the returned relay output (e.g. motor.setPower(output))</li>
 *     <li>checking {@link #isFinished()} to know when enough cycles have been
 *         collected</li>
 * </ol>

     *                         units, e.g. 0.6 means the relay drives the motor
     *                         to either +0.6 or -0.6. Pick a value large enough
     *                         to overcome static friction but small enough to
     *                         be safe -- 0.3 to 0.7 is typical.
     * @param hysteresis      a small deadband (in the same units as setpoint)
     *                         around the setpoint that the measurement must
     *                         cross before the relay switches. This prevents

     *                         typically enough.

     *                         once the system has settled into a steady limit
     *                         cycle. 5-10 is typical.

     *                         into the steady limit cycle. 1-2 is typical.
